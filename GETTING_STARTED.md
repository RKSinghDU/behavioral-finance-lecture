## ⚡ 3-Minute Quick Start

**Absolute minimum to get started teaching:**

1. **Read this table** (1 min):

| Bias | Example | Hand-Raise Prompt |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Anchoring | Reliance ₹450→₹25 | "Held stock waiting to break even?" |
| Confirmation | "Fund will bounce back" | "Last time you sought contradictory info?" |
| Overconfidence | 89% traders lose | "Think you'd be in the 11% who win?" |
| Loss Aversion | Hold losers, sell winners | "Held loser for 1+ year?" |
| Herd | Crypto mania | "Last investment: analyzed or recommended?" |
| Recency | Chase last year's fund | "Invested after seeing past performance?" |

2. **Memorize this opening** (1 min):
> "If we're all rational, why did you bid ₹800 for a ₹200 pen? Your phone number was higher? That's anchoring—and it costs real money."

3. **Remember this closing** (1 min):
> "You've confessed to at least 3 biases. That's not weakness—that's humanity. But now you KNOW. And you design systems. Choose wisely: exploit or protect?"

**You're ready!** (For a basic version. Read full materials for best results.)
